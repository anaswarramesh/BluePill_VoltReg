# BluePill_VoltReg
PCB design of a circuit that  converts a 12 V DC input into regulated 9 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V outputs using linear voltage regulators.
Overview
The circuit converts a 12 V DC input into regulated 9 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V outputs using linear voltage regulators. The 12 V input directly supplied to  the 9 V regulator,Output of 9V regulator connected to input of 5 V regulators, and the 5 V output is used as the input to the 3.3 V regulator to lower the heat dissipation.A diode is connected from input 12V to 9V regulator to protect the regulators from reverse polarity.Input and output capacitors are connected to regulators as per the datasheet recommendations.
